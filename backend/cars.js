      "Launched at the Geneva Salon in 2003, the Porsche Carrera GT was arguably the most extreme road-legal model in the Stuttgart firm’s history. Unsurprisingly, the German supercar was received with unrivalled enthusiasm and a rush of orders with 1,270 examples being produced between 2004 and 2006. Porsche’s new supercar broke new ground in many ways; it was the company’s first product to utilize an immensely strong but lightweight monocoque cabin and engine support unit of CFP (carbon fibre-reinforced plastic) with steel bracing around the windshield and passenger compartment. The front and rear suspension was based on state-of-the-art racing design, with upper and lower stainless-steel wishbones and inboard-mounted, rocker-arm-operated coil-over shock absorbers at all four corners. Huge ventilated and cross-drilled carbon-ceramic disc brakes were managed by multi-piston rear light-alloy callipers fitted behind forged magnesium-alloy centre-lock road wheels. Furthermore, the Formula One-derived V-10 engine now had a home. Sized at 5.7-liters in production form, this marvellous 40-valve powerplant developed an astonishing 613 horsepower at 8,000 rpm and 435 pound-feet of torque at 5,750 rpm. Power was delivered through a six-speed manual transaxle. To keep the car’s centre of gravity as low as possible, the engine employed dry-sump lubrication. The bodywork incorporated large air intake and exhaust vents, as well as a pair of removable CFP roof panels that could be stored within, a rear air diffuser, and a stability-enhancing rear wing that rose automatically at 75 mph. The leather interior was luxurious, with every amenity, and included a large digital information screen. At the centre of the cockpit is a gear selector knob made of birch and ash, Porsche’s subtle nod to the wooden shift knob on the storied 917. The Carrera GT was fitted with numerous safety systems, including traction control and anti-lock braking, all vital to a machine capable of 0–60 times of three seconds and a maximum speed of 200 mph, quite remarkable for a normally aspirated road car.",

      "The Lamborghini Reventon was first unveiled at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show and was the most expensive Lamborghini road car ever produced. The Reventon share many of its mechanical components with the LP640 Murciélago but features a completely reworked exterior and interior, both of which were designed to imitate that of an F15 Fighter Jet. Just 20 Reventon Coupes were produced. The Reventon utilises the same 6.5 litre naturally aspirated V12 engine as found in the Murciélago, although the increased use of carbon fibre composites liberates an extra 10bhp over the Murciélago, bringing the total to a guaranteed 641bhp at 8000rpm, powering the Reventon to a top speed of 211mph. This power is deployed through a 6-speed e-gear semi-automatic gearbox with the same AWD system found in the Murciélago. All Reventons produced were finished in the same ‘Reventon’ Grey, a mid-opaque grey which mimics the paint used on the F15 Fighter Jets. The aerospace theme continues throughout the interior, with the Reventon utilising a cutting edge TFT liquid crystal dash display which can change from a digital display to a quasi-analogical display at the press of a button. In 2009 Lamborghini unveiled the Roadster variant of the Reventon, with an even smaller production run of just 15 units. The car we are pleased to offer is a 2010 model and is one of just three produced in RHD variant. It is a UK supplied car with just 2 owners from new and sits today in fantastic condition after covering just over 1,100 miles. The car also benefits from a fresh service with Lamborghini London, ensuring it is ready to be enjoyed by its next owner.",

      "The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 was the immediate descendant for the much revered 275 GTB/4 and was first shown at the Paris motor show, 1968. The Daytona nickname was supposedly invented by Ferrari aficionados and affiliates of the media in acknowledgment of the factory’s unforgettable 1-2-3 triumph in the 1967 Daytona 24-hour edition. Alternatively, the story is that Ferrari had originally planned to employ the Daytona name, but changed their mind when news of the story leaked prior to the model’s reveal. The Tipo 251 engine was an improvement of the DOHC V12 of the 275 GTB/4, and at 4,390cc was roughly 33% larger in capacity. Six twin-choke Weber carburettors fed fuel to the engine, enabling it to produce 352bhp at 7,500rpm; enough to propel the 1,280kg machine to 60mph in under 5.5 seconds and on to a top speed of around 174mph, with a five-speed transaxle powering the rear wheels. Manufacture ran from 1968 to 1976, throughout which time a total of 1,406 examples are understood to have been built – 1,269 road-going Coupes and 122 official Spiders. The LHD example we are offering for sale was completed in 1971 and delivered new to North America via Bill Harrah’s Modern Classic Motors of Reno, Nevada.",
